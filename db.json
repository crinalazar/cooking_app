Shape into 16 small meatballs and set aside. Spray a large, lidded pan with a little spray oil and add the chorizo. Fry until the chorizo begins to create a little more oil in the pan, then add the rest of the onion and fry gently for a minute. Add the tinned tomatoes, beans, chopped red pepper and half a tomato tin of water to the pan. Stir everything together and bring to a simmer. Put the meatballs carefully in the sauce, pushing them down with a spoon into the sauce. Season with more black pepper, then partially cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes. Uncover the stew as you cook the basmati rice according to the packet instructions. Serve the stew with the rice alongside."

To serve, heat through thoroughly and serve with rice. If you like, scatter over some fresh coriander."

Spoon the batter into the cupcake cakes and bake for 18?20 minutes, or until well risen and firm to the touch. Leave to cool in the tin for at least 1 hour before icing. To make the frosting, sift the icing sugar into a large bowl and add the dairy-free spread and vanilla. Beat with a wooden spoon until smooth and creamy. Either spread the frosting on the cooled cupcakes or spoon into a large piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe on top. Leave to set for 30?60 minutes in the fridge before serving. "
